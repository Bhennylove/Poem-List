    <h1>THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME</h1>
    <p>I don't wanna to go but i have to go<br>
       It's sad to leave but i have to go<br>
       I'm gonna to miss the warm embraces<br>
       I'm gonna miss the sound of your voices<br>
       I'm just gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss everyone<br>
       Cos, there is no place like home<br>
<p>
    <p>I don't wanna go but i have to go<br>
        I can't always be here so i have to go<br>
        Coming home and going back is sad<br>
        I'm gonna miss your beautiful smile<br>
        I'm just gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss everyone<br>
Cos, there is no place like home<br>
